# Documentation Data

This document provides an overview of the codebase structure, including details about the files, their relationships, and the functionalities they provide.

## Codebase Summary

The codebase is structured to facilitate the analysis and documentation of large code projects. It is designed to be user-friendly and easily navigable, even for beginners.

### Key Features

- Recursive analysis of codebase up to 5 folder levels deep.
- Metadata extraction for each file, including names, sizes, and types.
- AST parsing to identify classes, functions, and key variables.
- Static analysis to map call relationships between files.
- AI-powered content generation for file descriptions.
- Folder purpose summarization.
- Visualization of architecture and call graphs.
- On-demand graph generation for specific files.
- Documentation formatted in Markdown, HTML, and JSON.
- Searchable, navigable documentation site.
- Progress tracking for analysis of large codebases.
- Customizable settings via a config file.
- Interactive CLI and API for queries.
- User dashboard for activity tracking and alerts.

## File Metadata

Each file within the codebase is analyzed to extract its metadata. This metadata includes the file's name, size, and type, which are essential for understanding the structure and composition of the project.

## Static Analysis

The static analysis component maps the relationships between files by identifying where functions are called and how files are interconnected. This analysis is crucial for understanding the dependencies and interactions within the codebase.

## Content Generation

Descriptions for each file and folder are generated using OpenAI's GPT-4 model. These descriptions aim to provide insights into the purpose and functionality of the code, making it easier for non-developers to understand the project.

## Visualization

Visual representations of the codebase are created to provide a clear and intuitive understanding of the project's architecture. These include high-level architecture diagrams and call graphs that show the relationships between different components.

## Documentation Format

The documentation is formatted in Markdown, HTML, and JSON to cater to different preferences and use cases. This multi-format approach ensures that the documentation is accessible and usable in various environments.

## Customization and Configuration

The tool is highly customizable, with settings that can be adjusted through a configuration file. This allows users to tailor the analysis and documentation process to their specific needs.

## User Dashboard

A user dashboard is available to track the progress of the analysis, view alerts, and access the history of the project's documentation. This dashboard serves as a central hub for users to monitor and interact with the tool.

## Conclusion

This documentation data provides a comprehensive overview of the codebase, offering valuable insights and a clear understanding of the project's structure and functionality. It serves as a foundational component of the automated documentation generator, enhancing the accessibility and maintainability of the codebase.
