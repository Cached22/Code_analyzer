# Codebase Documentation

Welcome to the codebase documentation generated by our Python script. This document provides an overview of the codebase structure, including details about the files, their relationships, and the overall architecture.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into several directories and files, each serving a specific purpose in the codebase analysis and documentation generation process.

- `main.py`: The entry point of the script.
- `config.json`: Contains configuration settings for the script.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists all the Python dependencies required by the script.
- `utils/`: Directory containing utility modules for analysis and visualization.
- `templates/`: Contains templates for generating documentation in various formats.
- `api/`: Holds the API endpoints for querying documentation and updating the dashboard.
- `cli/`: Command-line interface modules for interacting with the script.
- `web/`: Web application files for the interactive documentation site.
- `data/`: Stores the generated data in JSON and other formats.
- `logs/`: Log files for tracking analysis progress and errors.
- `.env`: Environment file storing sensitive information like the OpenAI API key.

## File Metadata Summary

Each file in the codebase is analyzed to extract metadata such as the filename, size, and type. This information is summarized here to provide a quick overview of the codebase contents.

## Code Structure

The code structure is determined by parsing the files using an AST parser to identify classes, functions, and key variables. This section outlines the hierarchy and relationships of these elements.

## Folder Summaries

Each folder is summarized to describe its purpose and the role it plays within the codebase. This summary is generated by analyzing the contents and types of files within each folder.

## Architecture Diagram

A high-level architecture diagram is provided to visualize the overall structure of the codebase.

## Call Graphs

Call graphs are generated to show the relationships and dependencies between different parts of the codebase.

![Call Graph](#callGraph)

## Customization and Configuration

The script can be customized via `config.json` to suit different projects. This section details the available settings and how to adjust them.

## Progress Tracking

The progress of the codebase analysis is tracked and displayed as a percentage. This helps in monitoring the status of large codebases.

## Interactive Documentation

The generated documentation is interactive, with a searchable and navigable site hosted to facilitate easy access to the information.

For more details, visit the documentation site or use the CLI/API for on-demand queries.
