The `logs/error.log` file is intended to store error logs for the application. Since it's a log file, it doesn't contain executable code, but rather it is written to by other parts of the application. However, I can provide you with a Python snippet that could be used by other parts of the application to write errors to this log file.

Here's an example of how you might append an error message to the `logs/error.log` file:

```python
import logging
from datetime import datetime

# Configure logging
logging.basicConfig(filename='logs/error.log', level=logging.ERROR, 
                    format='%(asctime)s:%(levelname)s:%(message)s')

def log_error(message):
    """
    Logs an error message to the error.log file.
    """
    logging.error(message)

# Example usage:
# try:
#     # Code that might raise an error
# except Exception as e:
#     log_error(f"An error occurred: {e}")
```

This code sets up basic logging to a file named `error.log` in the `logs` directory. It logs messages with the ERROR level, which includes an error message and a timestamp. The `log_error` function is a helper that other parts of your application can use to log errors.
